            Line Whit Out Hook
            <br>I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me.
            <br>When we're alone
            <br>You can hold my hand
            <br>If no one's home
            <br>you like it when I'm away?
            <br>If I went and hurt my body, baby
            <br>Would you love me the same?
            <br>I can feel all my bones coming back
            <br>And I'm craving motion
            <br>Mama never really learned how to live by herself
            <br>It's a curse
            <br>And it's growing
            <br>You're a pond and I'm an ocean
            <br>Oh, all my emotions
            <br>Feel like explosions when you are around
            <br>And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
            <br>Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            <br>I need you here to stay
            <br>I broke all my bones that day I found you
            <br>Crying at the lake
            <br>Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
            <br>Oh, and if I could take it all back
            <br>I swear that I would pull you from the tide
            <br>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
            <br>I said no, I said no
            <br>Listen close, it's a no
            <br>The wind is a-pounding on my back
            <br>And I found hope in a heart attack
            <br>Oh, at last, it is past
            <br>Now I've got it, and you can't have it
            <br>Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            <br>I need you here to stay
            <br>I broke all my bones that day I found you
            <br>Crying at the lake
            <br>Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
            <br>And if I could take it all back
            <br>I swear that I would pull you from the tide
            <br>Darling, when I'm fast asleep
            <br>I've seen this person watching me
            <br>Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
            <br>'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
            <br>There is nothing in between
            <br>And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
            <br>Watching over me, he's singing
            <br>"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
            <br>He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
            <br>Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            <br>I need you here to stay
            <br>Broke all my bones that day I found you
            <br>Crying at the lake
            <br>Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
            <br>And if I could take it all back
            <br>I swear that I would pull you from the tide
